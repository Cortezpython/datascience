# Data Professional Analysis using Python

## DESCRIPTION
2019, 2018, & 2017 Data Professional Salary Survey Results

## SUMMARY

How much do database administrators, analysts, architects, developers, and data scientists make? We asked, and 882 of you from 46 countries answered this year.

A few things to know about it:

The data is public domain. The license tab makes it clear that you can use this data for any purpose, and you don’t have to credit or mention anyone.
The spreadsheet includes the results for all 3 years. We’ve gradually asked more questions over time, so if a question wasn’t asked in a year, the answers are populated with Not Asked.
The postal code field was totally optional, and may be wildly unreliable. Folks asked to be able to put in small portions of their zip code, like the leading numbers.

## Getting Started

1. Open the jupyter notebook 
2. Install the required libraries (optional)
4. Execute the code

## Data Files

1. 2019_Data_Professional_Salary_Survey_Responses.xlsx is the data file on which the analysis was done
